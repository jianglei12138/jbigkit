#jbigkit

JBIG-KIT implements a highly effective data compression algorithm for bi-level high-resolution images such as fax pages or scanned documents. It provides a portable C library of compression and decompression functions with a documented interface that can easily be included into image or document processing software.

This code was based [jbigkit-2.1](http://freecode.com/projects/jbigkit/).
